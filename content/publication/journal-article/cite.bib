abstract = {The significant rise in digital threats and attacks has led to an increase in the use of cyber insurance as a risk treatment method intended to support organisations in the event of a breach. Insurance providers are set up to assume such residual risk, but they often require organisations to implement certain security controls a priori to reduce their exposure. We examine the assertion that cyber insurance promotes cyber security best practice by conducting a critical examination of cyber insurance application forms to determine how well they align with ISO 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the UK’s Cyber Essentials security standards. We achieve this by mapping questions and requirements expressed in insurance forms to the security controls covered in each of the standards. This allows us to identify security controls and standards that are considered – and likely most valued – by insurers and those that are neglected. We find that while there is some reasonable coverage across forms, there is an underrepresentation of best practice standards and controls generally, and particularly in some control areas (e.g., procedural/governance controls, incident response and recovery).},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to offer insights into the state of research covering cybersecurity, cyber insurance and small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It examines benefits of insurance to an SME’s security posture, challenges faced, and potential solutions and outstanding research questions. Design/methodology/approach Research objectives were formulated, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol was used to perform a systematic literature review (SLR). A total of 19 papers were identified from an initial set of 451. Findings This research underscores the role of cybersecurity in the value proposition of cyber insurance for SMEs. The findings highlight the benefits that cyber insurance offers SMEs including protection against cyber threats, financial assistance and access to cybersecurity expertise. However, challenges hinder SME’s engagement with insurance, including difficulties in understanding cyber risk, lack of cybersecurity knowledge and complex insurance policies. Researchers recommend solutions, such as risk assessment frameworks and government intervention, to increase cyber insurance uptake/value to SMEs. Research limitations/implications There is a need for further research in the risk assessment and cybersecurity practices of SMEs, the influence of government intervention and the effectiveness of insurers in compensating for losses. The findings also encourage innovation to address the unique needs of SMEs. These insights can guide future research and contribute to enhancing cyber insurance adoption. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first SLR to comprehensively examine the intersection of cybersecurity and cyber insurance specifically in the context of SMEs.},
